## Intro
Born and raised in Siberia, Russia, Sofya had decided to pursue further education in USA. She obtained a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the Ohio State University; and shortly after, joined IBM as a full-time Software Developer. Dedicated to make the most out of her time at IBM, Sofya participated in numerous computing projects, presentations and demos, held multiple leadership positions, leveraged Watson tools, and also mentored local, underprivileged elementary students on the basics of computer architecture, robotics, mathematics and logic.

In 2015, Sofya enrolled in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern, in order to build a strong knowledge base in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and mathematical modeling. 

Her career and research objectives are to develop intelligent systems to aid in deep-world exploration for the advancement of modern science. This includes, but not limited to, the design of autonomous agents that will gather valuable data from unknown territories, as well as the implementation of artificial intelligence systems that will optimally process vast amounts of information and generate new theories.
